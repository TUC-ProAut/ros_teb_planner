% Test script to use TebPlanner Class methods to send data to

% the test_TebPlanner script. Use polygonal robot footprint of

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% instantiate TebPlanner class
tebplan = TebPlanner;

%% set initial plan for the robot
% first segment: straight line along x-axis
poses = zeros(10,3);
poses(1:7 ,1) = -3:3; poses(1:7 ,2) = -0.5; poses(1:6 ,3) =  0;

% second segment: straight line along y-axis
poses(8:10,1) =    3; poses(8:10,2) =  1:3; poses(8:10,3) =  pi/2;
% set initial plan
tebplan.setInitialPlan(poses);

%% set start velocity of the robot
% vx = 0.5 m/s; vy = 0
tebplan.setStartVelocity(0.5,0);

%% add boundaries as polyline obstacles
tebplan.addPolylineObstacle([-3, 1,0; 2, 1,0; 2,3,0]);
tebplan.addPolylineObstacle([-3,-1,0; 4,-1,0; 4,3,0]);

%% add pedestrian as point obstacle
tebplan.addCircularObstacle([1,-0.5])

%% add waypoint (optional)
%tebplan.addWaypoint(-1,2);

% fine tuning: increase the weight of the waypoint to make the plan
%              pass through it
%              (dynamic reconfigure: Optimization/weight_viapoint)

%% plan using services
tebplan.plan();

%% publish the obstacles and robot footprint continuously
% get internal rosnode
rosnode = tebplan.getRosNode();
% create publisher and an empty message
pub = robotics.ros.Publisher(rosnode,'/teb_planner_node_pa/publish',...
    'std_msgs/Empty');

% create a timer object
t=timer;
% set publish rate to 4 Hz
t.Period = 0.25;
t.ExecutionMode = 'fixedRate';
% publish on each timer event
t.TimerFcn = 'pub.send(msg)';
% start the timer
start(t);

% stop the timer (optional)
%stop(t);

%% further testing (optional)
% a) do continuous replanning
%t.TimerFcn = 'tebplan.replan()';

% b) minimize distance to boundaries
%    (dynamic reconfigure: Obstacles/min_obstacle_dist)

% c) auto generate waypoints from initial trajectory
%    (dynamic reconfigure: ViaPoints/global_plan_viapoint_sep)
